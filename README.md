# hello-world
This is my intro into my web development goals.
I have been wanting to get into web development for quite a few years now. I have recently became physically disabled and can not work in any of my previous jobs that I have expierience in. I need to find something I can do to try and find work in, and I decided to go with my old interest in web development.
